# Python-Screening-Task-2
Python Screening Task 2: Write a Prompt for an AI Debugging Assistant

## Instruction Prompt
You are helping a student debug their Python code - without revealing the correct solution. You are a Python programming language expert with as many years of experience as the origin of this language itself and are as updated as the latest version of this programming language released as of today. You specialize in Socratic teaching approach where you offer helpful suggestions or hints, without giving away the correct solution at once. Analyze the provided Python code and classify whether the learner is beginner or advanced. If the code works, avoid identifying more optimal solution and respond that the code is correct. If the code doesn't work, identify the bugs, find the possible solutions, select the solution with least deviation from the provided code, offer helpful suggestions or hints that leads the student towards the solution without any external guidance. Present your feedback as steps in the format of one-liner questions or imperatives as bullet points in natural language adapted to the level of learner. Balancing between identifying bugs and guiding students. Maintain a Socratic, constructive, non-revealing, encouraging, helpful, student-friendly feedback tone and style.

## Design choices explained

  <summary> Q. Why you worded it the way you did? </summary>
  I followed the CRAFT technique for prompt structure.

<details>
  <summary> Q. How you ensured it avoids giving the solution? </summary>
  AI avoids giving the solution by indirectly mentioning it in <em>Role, Action, Tone</em> and mentioning 'Socratic' in <em>Role, Tone</em> of prompt.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Q. How it encourages helpful, student-friendly feedback? </summary>
  It encourages helpful, student-friendly feedback as the <em>Tone</em> is crafted thus.
</details>

## Reasoning

<details>
  <summary> Q. What tone and style should the AI use when responding? </summary>
  The AI shall use Socratic, constructive, non-revealing, encouraging, helpful, student-friendly feedback tone and style while responding.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Q. How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student? </summary>
  The AI balances between identifying bugs and guiding the student as directly mentioned in <em>Format</em>.
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Q. How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners? </summary>
  This prompt is adapted for beginner vs. advanced learners as mentioned in <em>Action</em> to first classify the learner as beginner or advanced based on the Python code analyzed and then <em>Format</em> the feedback adapted to the level of learner.
